Upgrade from 0.9.1 to 0.10.0
============================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.10, which was released
concurrently with SecureDrop 0.10.0 on October 23, 2018. Follow the Tails
graphical prompts on your workstations to perform this upgrade.

On a subsequent boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates.
Choose "Update Now" on each of the workstations:

.. image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

Please note that this only updates the SecureDrop code on your Tails
workstations. Tails upgrades must be performed separately.

If you don't see a graphical updater, you may be running an older
version of the SecureDrop code on your workstation (earlier than
0.7.0). You can update as follows: ::

    cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
    git fetch --tags
    gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
    git tag -v 0.10.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 0.10.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '0.10.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. important:: 
        If you haven't already updated your workstations when SecureDrop
        0.9.1 was released, you'll need to update your workstations
        manually. Due to a bug in the graphical SecureDrop updater that was
        fixed in SecureDrop 0.9.1 (released on September 6, 2018),
        attempting an update of your SecureDrop workstation code on your
        *Journalist* or *Admin Workstations* using the graphical updater
        may fail with an error message: "WARNING: Signature verification failed."

        Should you encounter this message, follow the instructions in the
        :doc:`Upgrade from 0.8.0 to 0.9.1<0.8.0_to_0.9.1>` guide.


Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------

If you have previously downgraded your kernel, as part of the the upgrade
process to SecureDrop 0.10.0, the default Linux kernel will change to the
latest released kernel (version 4.4.144). 

We have tested this kernel extensively against :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`
and other common configurations. Please consult our :doc:`kernel troubleshooting guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`
for instructions on how to compare the differences between kernel versions and
how to roll back to an earlier version if necessary.
 
.. important::

  The 3.14.x series kernel will be removed with release 0.11.0 (scheduled
  for December 11). Please :ref:`report kernel compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  immediately to avoid extended downtime.
