Upgrade from 0.8.0 to 0.9.1
===========================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.9, which was released
concurrently with SecureDrop 0.9.0 on September 5, 2018. Follow the Tails
graphical prompts on your workstations to perform this upgrade.

Due to a bug in the graphical SecureDrop updater that was fixed in SecureDrop
0.9.1 (released on September 6, 2018), attempting an update of your SecureDrop
workstation code on your *Journalist* or  *Admin Workstations* using the
graphical updater will fail with an error message: "WARNING: Signature
verification failed." You need to update your workstations manually by
following the steps below.

1. Start the Journalist or Admin Workstation with Persistent Storage unlocked
   and an
   `administration password set <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/index.en.html>`__.

2. Once you have a working Tor connection, open a Terminal by selecting from the
   menu:
   **Applications** ▸ **Favorites** ▸ **Terminal**

3. Change your working directory to the SecureDrop installation directory using
   the command:
   ``cd ~/Persistent/securedrop/``

4. Verify the installed version using the command:
   ``git status``

The command output will include the line "HEAD detached at <version>",
where "<version>" is your current installed version.

If the workstation code is at version 0.7.0 or earlier:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _update_workstation_code_from_070:

Update the workstation code to version 0.8.0 (not 0.9.0 or 0.9.1) manually
before proceeding:

.. code:: sh

   git fetch --tags
   gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
   git tag -v 0.8.0

The output should include the following two lines:


.. code:: sh

   gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
   gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what you see
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out version 0.8.0:

.. code:: sh

  git checkout 0.8.0

Please verify that the output of this command does not contain the text
"warning: refname '0.8.0' is ambiguous".

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '0.8.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Run the following command:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin setup

Now, proceed with the 0.8.0 to 0.9.1 update as described below.

If the workstation code is at version 0.8.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the following steps to upgrade your workstation to version 0.9.1:

1. Update the workstation code using the command:
   ``./securedrop-admin update``
2. Update the workstation dependencies using the command:
   ``./securedrop-admin setup``
3. Update your workstation Tails settings using the command:
   ``./securedrop-admin tailsconfig``

You will be prompted for the temporary administration password set on the Tails
greeter screen.

This should address the problem with the graphical updater for future releases.

Database Migration May Take Time to Complete
--------------------------------------------
Some of the changes in SecureDrop 0.9.0 require a database migration that can take
additional time during the upgrade process, especially if you are not using an
SSD on your *Application Server*, or if you store data about a large number of
sources and submissions on the server. This is normal behavior during the
automatic upgrade, and the *Source Interface* and *Journalist Interface* will
become available again once the upgrade has been completed. In case of a service
outage of more than two hours, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

New Dialogs in Tails 3.9
------------------------
When you run the ``securedrop-admin setup`` command, Tails as of version 3.9
will prompt to install packages automatically from persistent storage on each
boot. These apt packages don't need to persist; click on `Install Only Once`
when you see this dialog:

      |Tails Apt Persistence|

.. |Tails Apt Persistence| image:: ../images/tails-install-once-or-every-time.png

Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------

SecureDrop 0.9.0 ships with an update of the Linux kernel running on your
*Application* and *Monitor Servers*, from version 4.4.135 to version 4.4.144.
If you have not previously changed your default kernel, your server will
boot into the new kernel automatically on its next reboot.

We have tested this kernel extensively against :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`
and other common configurations. Please consult our :doc:`kernel troubleshooting guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`
for instructions on how to compare the differences between kernel versions and
how to roll back to an earlier version if necessary.

.. important::

  It is of critical importance for the security and stability of your instance
  that you :ref:`report kernel compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  to us as soon as you become aware of them.

Enabling the New Kernel After a Downgrade
-----------------------------------------

If you have previously downgraded your kernel to the 3.14.x series due to
compatibility issues with the kernel that shipped with SecureDrop 0.7.0 or
later, we urge you to test the latest kernel (version 4.4.144).

You can test the new kernel without downtime by following
:ref:`our instructions for testing and enabling a new kernel after a downgrade
<Test and Enable an Updated Kernel>`. Please note that this is *only* necessary
if you have manually downgraded the kernel; otherwise, the new kernel will be
enabled automatically.

.. important::

  The next regular release of SecureDrop, version 0.10.0, will no longer
  preserve a preference for a downgraded kernel. If you have downgraded your
  kernel, testing the new kernel and :ref:`reporting compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  is of critical importance to minimize the risk of an outage of your SecureDrop
  instance.
